### Features ###

#### Classic Editor ####

*  Adds "Embed Video" button to help you create very powerful `[arve]` shortcodes.
*  Takes over WordPress embeds with URLs on their own line and `[embed]` shortcodes.
*  Can take over WP's default video file embeds.

#### Gutenberg ####

*  Works with Embed, YouTube, Vimeo, Shortcode ... blocks.
*  Provides it's own powerful ARVE Block with all the features the `[arve]` shortcode offers, with a nice UI and detailed settings descriptions.

#### Both ####

*   Magically makes videos responsive you already embedded with WordPress default features.
*   SEO friendly, lets you specify title, description, upload date to provide search engines with the schema.org data they like to have for better indexing. Pro can autofill this for you.
*   No 'lock in' if you do not use the ARVE Gutenberg Block or `[arve]` shortcodes.
*   Supports [almost every video host](https://nextgenthemes.com/plugins/arve-pro/#support-table) that supports iframe embed codes.
*   Embeds via pasting the URL in its own line just like WordPress!
*   Optionally use very powerful Shortcodes instead.
*   Clean shortcode syntax `[arve url="https://youtu.be/yUCFRL43Zm4" parameters="start=30" ... /]`, no unnecessary shortcode wrapping.
*   One shortcode or Block for all video providers.
*   Responsive embeds with CSS, much better than with JavaScript.
*   Tries to be as unobtrusive as possible, sets 'hide brand' variables if supported, disables related videos from other channels at the end â€¦ to help keep people on your site rather then going to YouTube or keep watching videos.
*   Limited Autoplay (for providers that support it, they may mute it. Mobile browsers prevent autoplay with audio so ARVE will automatically mute HTML5 videos set to autoplay)
*   Custom URL parameters to use all options providers offer.
*   Optional maximal width.
*   Video alignment.
*   Detailed description of options in-place.
*   Automatic detected and custom aspect ratio.
