### Why are my videos not filling their container? ###

You may need to adjust your 'Maximal Width' setting to your liking.

You are most likely use `align`, this plugin has a option for limiting video width with alignment. If you want your videos to fill their containers then you should not use the `align` shortcode attribute.

### Can you add a video provider? ###

Feel free to ask.

### How do I embed videos from a unlisted providers / iframes? ###

This plugin not changes anything to usual HTML `<iframe>` embed codes you have to use the shortcodes or the Gutenberg Block. They will become `[arve url="https://..."]`. The url represents what is the `src` in HTML embeds. It works as simple as this, if the `[arve]` shortcode does not detect a known URL structure then it will treat the URL as a `src` for the iframe. 

### Why does my YouTube video not repeat/loop? ###

This plugins embed is considered as 'custom player' by YouTube so you have to pass the video ID as playlist parameters to make the loop work.

`[arve url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvRqvX413Ik" parameters="loop=1&playlist=pvRqvX413Ik"]`
