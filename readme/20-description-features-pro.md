*   **Disable links in embeds (killer feature!)**<br>
    For example: Clicking on a title in a YouTube embed will not open a new popup/tab/window. **Prevent video hosts to lead your visitors away from your site!** Note this also breaks sharing functionality and is not possible when the provider requires flash. Try it on [this page](https://nextgenthemes.com/plugins/advanced-responsive-video-embedder-pro/). Right click on links still works.
*   **Lazyload mode**<br>
    Make your site load **faster** by loading only a image instead of the entire video player on pageload.  
*   **Lazyload -> Lightbox**<br>
    Shows the Video in a Lightbox after clicking a preview image
*   **Link -> Lightbox**<br>
    Use simple links as triggers for lightboxed videos
*   Automatic or custom thumbnail images
*   Automatic or custom titles on top of your thumbnails
*   'Expand on click' feature
*   3 hover styles
*   2 play icon styles to choose from
*   Responsive thumbnails using cutting edge HTML5 technology
*   **Feel good about yourself**<br>
