<p>Have downloaded and paid for at least 4 other video players that use lightbox. Each one has major flaws. This products works perfectly. If you use the OnSite Editor, then just copy the short code and it works great.</p>

<p>For speed, the product uses the thumbnails from the server. So many of the other products do NOT do this and it slows the page rendering. This product should appear first on the WordPress search. Spent 3 days of my life wasted on other products, only to delete each one. <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/advanced-responsive-video-embedder/reviews/?filter=5">review by jodani</a></p>

<p>So I have a responsive theme but on pages with you tube videos it wasn&#39;t making the you tube videos fit in the mobile screen. I have spent the last hour trying many plugins and researching on google and finally I installed this. And I didn&#39;t have to update any settings or anything just refreshed a post with videos and all the sudden it is beautiful and responsive on my mobile phone!!!!!!

<p>I used a lot of high ranking plug-ins but they still broke my design. Downloaded this and worked right away. Thanks! <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/advanced-responsive-video-embedder/reviews/?filter=5">review by crconnell89</a></p>
