	<li><strong>Feel good about yourself</strong><br>
		for supporting my long time work on this plugin. Tons of hours, weekends … always worked on <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-responsive-video-embedder/changelog/">improving it</a> 4+ years.</li>

	<li><strong>Disable links in embeds (killer feature!)</strong><br>
		For example: Clicking on a title in a YouTube embed will not open a new popup/tab/window. <strong>Prevent video hosters to lead your visitors away from your site!</strong> Note this also breaks sharing functionality and is not possible when the provider requires flash. Try it on <a href="https://nextgenthemes.com/plugins/advanced-responsive-video-embedder-pro/">this page</a>. Right click on links still works.</li>

	<li><strong>Lazyload mode</strong><br>
		Make your site load <strong>faster</strong> by loading only a image instead of the entire video player on pageload.<br>
	</li>

	<li><strong>Lazyload -&gt; Lightbox</strong><br>
		Shows the Video in a Lightbox after clicking a preview image</li>

	<li><strong>Link -&gt; Lightbox</strong><br>
		Use simple links as triggers for lightboxed videos</li>

  <li>Show the latest video of a youtube channel by using the channel URL (updated/cached hourly)</li>
	<li>Automatic or custom thumbnail images</li>
	<li>Automatic or custom titles on top of your thumbnails</li>
	<li>'Grow on click' feature</li>
	<li>3 hover styles</li>
	<li>2 play icon styles to choose from</li>
	<li>Responsive thumbnails using cutting edge HTML5 technology</li>

		<h4>&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; Finally something that works</h4>
		So I have a responsive theme but on pages with you tube videos it wasn't making the you tube videos fit in the mobile screen. I have spent the last hour trying many plugins and researching on google and finally I installed this. And I didn't have to update any settings or anything just refreshed a post with videos and all the sudden it is beautiful and responsive on my mobile phone!!!!!! THANK YOU!!!!<br>

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### I have a problem ... ###

Please report it on [nextgenthemes.com/support/](https://nextgenthemes.com/support/) **and plaese not on the wordpess.org forums, thanks.**

### How to get the pro version working? ###

1. Go though the purchase process on [nextgenthemes.com/advanced-responsive-video-embedder-pro/](https://nextgenthemes.com/advanced-responsive-video-embedder-pro/)
1. Follow the 3 easy steps you get with the purchase receipt. It is basically downloading a arve-pro.zip and installing it through your WordPress Admin panel.

### Why are my videos not filling their container? ###

You are most likely use `align`, this plugin has a option for limiting video with with alignment. If you want your videos to fill their containers then you should not use the `align` shortcode attribute. This assumes that you left the 'Video Maximal Width' field on the options page empty (default + recommended)

### Can you add a video provider? ###

I have no plans on implementing providers that include videos via JavaScript such as www.nicovideo.jp. I also will not implement video services from mainstream media news organizations. For others, feel free to ask.

### How do I embed videos from a unlisted providers / iframes? ###

This plugin not changes anything to usual HTML `<iframe>` embed codes you have to use the shortcode creator dialog and paste iframe embed codes there or write them manually. They will become `[arve url="https://..."]`. The url represents what is the `src` in HTML embeds. It works as simple as this, if the [arve] shortcode does not detect a knows URL structure then it will treat the URL as a `src` for the iframe.

### Why does my Youtube video not repeat/loop? ###

This plugins embed is considered as 'custom player' by YouTube so you have to pass the video ID as playlist parameters to make the loop work.

`[arve url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvRqvX413Ik" parameters="loop=1&playlist=pvRqvX413Ik"]`
