### Features ###

* Embeds via pasting the URL in its own line just like WordPress!
* Optionally use Shortcodes instead
* One single button for all providers (for most providers not required because of URL embeds, but allows to create custom shortcodes with advanced features within seconds)
* Responsive embeds with CSS, much better then with JS IMO
* Tries to be as unobtrusive as possible, sets 'hide brand' variables if supported, disabled related videos at the end ... to help keep people on your Site rather then going to YouTube or keep watching videos
* Clean Shortcode syntax `[vimeo id="123456"]` no ugly URLs, no unnecessary Shortcode wrapping.
* Autostart (for providers that support them)
* Custom URL Parameters to use all options providers offer
* Optional maximal width
* Video alignment
* General iframe support for any provider that not included that support responsive iframe embeds or any URL you with to display in a iframe.
* Detailed description of options in-place, also available translated into German, French and Spanish.
* Custom Aspect Ratio

### Additional Features with the Pro Addon ###

* Feel good about yourself for helping me support my long time work on this plugin. Tons of hours, weekends ... always worked on [improving](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-responsive-video-embedder/changelog/) 3+ years.
* Lazyload mode: Only load a preview image on pageload instead of the Video itself, makes you site load faster.
* Lazyload -> Lightbox: Shows the Video in a Lightbox after clicking a preview image.
* Lazyload -> HTML5 Fullscreen: (experimental) This is a dream come true for me. Be aware that this has a Issue of going fullsceen a 2nd time from within fullscreen and fullscreen Buttons not working as expected.
* Lazyload -> Half Screen Sticky: (experimental) Video that fills about half the screen/window and lets users continue to scroll and read the site, start writing a comment ... while watching a video. This relies on modern HTML5 features (calc, vw + vh) and may not work everywhere.

### Quick Introduction ###

URLs like `https://vimeo.com/124400795` on its own line will produce full responsive embeds. If you already use this with WordPress default, this is the perfect drop-in replacement to make everything responsive, no need to do anything.

https://vimeo.com/124400795

Extremly customizable with support for anything providers offer to customize embeds. Other plugins offer some of this features with huge bloated dialogs, ARVE is different, it just lets you do anything you want if you have a few seconds to look up what the parameters do.

Here we are starting the video at the 30 seconds mark, disable the fullscreen button, switch to YouTubes light theme and set the aspect_ratio to cinemascope.

`https://youtu.be/Q6goNzXrmFs?start=30&fs=0&theme=light&arve[aspect_ratio]=21:9`

the same thing can be done with a shortcode:

`[youtube id="Q6goNzXrmFs" parameters="start=30 fs=0 theme=light" aspect_ratio="21:9"]`

https://youtu.be/Q6goNzXrmFs?start=30&fs=0&theme=light&arve[aspect_ratio]=21:9

### Pro Addon Feature Demonstration ###

`[vimeo id="124858722" mode="lazyload" maxwidth="400" align="left"]] This is a demo of a aligned lazyloaded video [...]`

 This is a demo of a aligned lazyloaded video that has a maximal width set and will grow on click before loading the video.

You can open up a lightbox with a normal link [youtube id="Q6goNzXrmFs" mode="link-lightbox" link_text="click me"] with this sortcode:

`[youtube id="Q6goNzXrmFs" mode="link-lightbox" link_text="click me"]`
<div class="clearfix"></div>

We can also center videos and open then inside a Colorbox. This requires the jQuery Colorbox plugin to be installed. This site uses theme 3.

`[youtube id="Q6goNzXrmFs" mode="lazyload-lightbox" maxwidth="600" align="center"]`



### Lazyloaded Preview Images in HD ###

Contrary to what you might think, thumbnail in ARVE does not nessasary mean small images. You can provide your own images with thumbnail="https://your.image.url" or thumbnail="1234" where 1234 is the ID of the image in your WP Media Gallery. Most providers, which support automatic thubnails also support HD thumbnail images and this plugin will get the highest aviable size.

#### &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; Finally something that works

So I have a responsive theme but on pages with you tube videos it wasn't making the you tube videos fit in the mobile screen. I have spent the last hour trying many plugins and researching on google and finally I installed this. And I didn't have to update any settings or anything just refreshed a post with videos and all the sudden it is beautiful and responsive on my mobile phone!!!!!! THANK YOU!!!!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

### I have a problem ... ###

Please report it on [community.nextgenthemes.com](https://community.nextgenthemes.com) **and plaese not on the wordpess.org forums, thanks.**

### How to get the pro version working? ###

1. Go though the purchase process on [nextgenthemes.com/advanced-responsive-video-embedder-pro/](https://nextgenthemes.com/advanced-responsive-video-embedder-pro/)
1. Follow the 3 easy steps you get with the purchase reciept. Basically downloading a arve-pro.zip and installing it through your WordPress Admin panel.

### My self hosted video that I embed with iframe is always autoplaying, how to disable autplay? ###

You can not at this point. I do not recommend the bad workarround I gave out before to used iframes with .mp4/.ogg/.mkv files directly as depending on browser (and setup, I think some IE) it may lead to download instead of embed this just uses the default browsers behavior as if you navigate to a video file and you are stick with the defaults the browser throws at you. Most disliked in the autoplay. Propper support for self hosted videos is plannend, probably even for the free version but no estimated release date.

### Why are my videos not filling their container? ###

You are most likely use `align`, this plugin has a option for limiting video with with alignment. If you want your videos to fill their containers then you should not use the `align=left/right/center` shortcode attribute or the `arve[align]=` URL parameter. This assumes that you left the 'Video Maximal Width' field on the options page empty (default + recommended)

### Why are videos opening full window (provider URL) when I click on them? ###

You most likely do not have the 'jQuery Colorbox' Plugin installed or JavaScript disabled both is needed for thumbnail mode. Another reason can be that do have JavascriptErrors or Browser addons like NoScript blocking JavaScript trom Executing.

### Can you add a video provider? ###

I have no plans on implementing providers that include videos via JavaScript such as www.nicovideo.jp. I also will not implement videos from mainstream media news organizations. For others, feel free to ask.

### How do I embed Iframes? ###

This plugin not changes anything to usual HTML `<iframe>` embed codes you have to use the shortcode creator dialog and paste iframe embed codes there or write them manually. They will become `[iframe id="https://..."]`. The id represents what is the `src` in HTML embeds.

### Why does my Youtube video not repeat/loop? ###

This plugins embed is considered as 'custom player' by YouTube so you have to pass the video ID as playlist parameters to make the loop work.

`[youtube id="123456" parameters="loop=1 playlist=123456"]`
