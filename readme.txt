Easy responsive video embeds via URLs or shortcodes. Perfect drop-in replacement for WordPress' default embeds. Best plugin for videos?

## Description ##

The best WordPress plugin for videos? Supports close to everything you can imagine, still keeping it easy & simple.

It is very likely the one and only plugin you will ever need to handle video embeds on your WordPress site(s). It goes far beyond just making your videos responsive!

Especially new users and people who want to use the new Block Editor (Gutenberg):

### Features ###

*   SEO friendly, lets you specify title, description, upload date to provide search engines with the schema.org data they like to have for better indexing.

### Reviews ###

#### &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; The best there is – I have tried many…  ####
Have downloaded and paid for at least 4 other video players that use lightbox. Each one has major flaws. This products works perfectly. If you use the OnSite Editor, then just copy the short code and it works great.

[arve url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7g8-GxLTSc" /]

For speed, the product uses the thumbnails from the server. So many of the other products do NOT do this and it slows the page rendering. This product should appear first on the WordPress search. Spent 3 days of my life wasted on other products, only to delete each one. [review by jodani](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/advanced-responsive-video-embedder/reviews/?filter=5)

#### &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; Finally something that works ####
So I have a responsive theme but on pages with you tube videos it wasn't making the you tube videos fit in the mobile screen. I have spent the last hour trying many plugins and researching on google and finally I installed this. And I didn't have to update any settings or anything just refreshed a post with videos and all the sudden it is beautiful and responsive on my mobile phone!!!!!! THANK YOU!!!!

#### &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; Only Plug-in that worked ####
I used a lot of high ranking plug-ins but they still broke my design. Downloaded this and worked right away. Thanks! [review by crconnell89](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/advanced-responsive-video-embedder/reviews/?filter=5)

This plugin is financed by sales of the [Pro Addon](https://nextgenthemes.com/plugins/arve-pro/).

### [Pro Addon](https://nextgenthemes.com/plugins/arve-pro/) ###

**10% off** first year with discount code `wporg`

*   **Disable links in embeds (killer feature!)**<br>
    For example: Clicking on a title in a YouTube embed will not open a new popup/tab/window. **Prevent video hosts to lead your visitors away from your site!** Note this also breaks sharing functionality and is not possible when the provider requires flash. Try it on [this page](https://nextgenthemes.com/plugins/arve-pro/). Right click on links still works.
*   **Lazyload mode**<br>
    Make your site load **faster** by loading only a image instead of the entire video player on pageload.

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### I have a problem ... ###

Please report it on [nextgenthemes.com/support/](https://nextgenthemes.com/support/) **and please do not on the wordpess.org forums, thanks.**

### How to get the pro version working? ###

1. Go though the purchase process on [nextgenthemes.com/arve-pro/](https://nextgenthemes.com/arve-pro/)
1. Follow the 3 easy steps you get with the purchase receipt. It is basically downloading a arve-pro.zip and installing it through your WordPress Admin panel.

### Why are my videos not filling their container? ###

You are most likely use `align`, this plugin has a option for limiting video width with alignment. If you want your videos to fill their containers then you should not use the `align` shortcode attribute. This assumes that you left the 'Video Maximal Width' field on the options page empty.

### Can you add a video provider? ###

ARVE Already support all the provider the offer iframe embed codes. Just use the `src="https://this-URL"` url from any iframe embed code on a arve shortcode like this [arve url="https://embed-code-src-url" /]. For well known providers ARVE builds this URL automatically so you just need the video URL on their page. If the ID for a video can be extracted from the URL and is the same in the embed code its easy to add it to the plugin, just asked. For example `https://example.com/video/112233/` and their embed code might be `<iframe src="https://example.com/video/112233/embed" ...><iframe>` in such case or if you not sure just ask.

### How do I embed videos from a unlisted providers / iframes? ###

This plugin not changes anything to usual HTML `<iframe>` embed codes you have to use the shortcode creator dialog and paste iframe embed codes there or write them manually. They will become `[arve url="https://..."]`. The url represents what is the `src` in HTML embeds. It works as simple as this, if the [arve] shortcode does not detect a known URL structure then it will treat the URL as a `src` for the iframe.

### Why does my YouTube video not repeat/loop? ###

This plugins embed is considered as 'custom player' by YouTube so you have to pass the video ID as playlist parameters to make the loop work.

`[arve url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvRqvX413Ik" parameters="loop=1&playlist=pvRqvX413Ik"]`

### planned for release 9.0.0 ###

This update is very long in the making and I hope it will pay off somehow, hopefully literally. A lot things happened in the code that will not be visible to the end users directly but made the code more modern and easier to maintain.

[Please help test](https://nextgenthemes.com/please-help-test-the-beta-version/)

[More details on this **mayor** update](https://nextgenthemes.com/improvements-in-arve-9-0-and-arve-pro-5-0/)

New:

* Minimum PHP required is now 5.6.
* Finally the ARVE Gutenberg block is here! Its not polished yet and there is still work to be done.
* Optional admin bar button to quick access settings. Disable it in ARVE settings bothers you.
* Added Bitchute
* `av1mp4` shortcode parameter so serve [AV1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AV1) encoded files best named .av1.mp4 (to be used together with `mp4` or `webm`)
* Settings page overhaul, using my own little settings framework. All addon options can be seen and set (without effect) before actually having the addons installed.
* Option to

Fixes:

* YouTube live links are now working correctly.
* TED embed url.
* Facebook embeds.
* Twitch embeds.

Improved:

* Generated iframe src will match what providers send over oembed.
* Lots of code improvements that may not be noticeable to users but took a lot of time and will make the plugin more maintainable and easier to extend.
* Removed the `lang` shortcode parameter that was only used for TED talks video subtitle display. This is now taken from the `language=x` url query.
* Embeds work though WPs oembed system now that comes with a more stable codebase and better caching system for embeds.
* Aspect ratios are now auto detected for all providers WP supports through oEmbed.
* Aspect ratio field is now auto filled when pasting a iframe embed code into the shortcode UI or Gutenberg UI.
* Removed jQuery dependency for frontend JavaScript.
* Prevent autoplay of multiple videos, only the first video on pageload will be autoplayed.

Removed:

* Hack to support direct embedding of Dropbox videos because it no longer works.
* Vimeo only `start` shortcode attribute. Use vimeo urls with `#t=30` at the end for starting time in seconds instead.

Probably things I forgot about, working on this for ~1 year

### 2020-10-10 - 8.10.28 ###

* Tested and marked as compatible with WP 5.5.1

### 2020-08-02 - 8.10.27 ###

* Fix: **SORRY!** message about beta testing was **not intended** to show hourly it was intended to show only once per user.
* Fix: Link in that messages was also to a 404 page, can it get worse?

### 2020-07-25 - 8.10.24 ###

* Fix: `embedURL` SEO output.

### 2020-05-14 - 8.10.23 ###

* Improved: Automatically set HTML5 videos that are set to autoplay to also be muted so they may play as browsers no longer allow unmuted autoplay.

### 2019-11-05 - 8.10.20 ###

* Big version update with Gutenberg Block is coming [please help testing](https://nextgenthemes.com/plugins/arve/help-testing-the-beta-version/)

* Improved: Switch Youku embeds to https set to default 16:9 aspect ratio.
* Improved: added `allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox` to sandbox attribute. This eliminates the need for `sandbox="false"` for Vimeo action links to work. And just in general I think its a good idea.

### 2019-07-31 - 8.10.6 ###

* Fix: Vimeo Action links not working correctly in Chrome when Sandbox is enabled. You can fix this by adding `sandbox="false"` to your shortcodes. But the ARVE Pro "disable links" option will no longer work.
* Improved: Deprecated `requires_flash` attribute and `Iframe Flash` option. Replaced is the new `sandbox` shortcode attribute.

### 2019-01-23 - 8.10.4 ###

* Fix: PHP compatibility lowered to official 5.3 as there was accidentally 5.4+ code used. Make sure you are on PHP 7.3 or at least 5.6 for the upcoming future as WP itself will require 5.6 this year. Its also insecure to run on those outdated versions: https://secure.php.net/supported-versions.php.

### 2019-01-16 - 8.10.2 ###

* Fix: Base code to fix titles not showing over thumbnails in recent Pro Addon version.

### 2018-06-07 - 8.9.5 ###

* Fixed: When pasting embed codes into the Shortcode UI dialog the `src=` will be extracted even when no quotes are used.
* Improved: Use youtube-nocookie.com domain again it is GPRP/Privacy friendly. Note the name is confusing as it sets cookies, but only when the user plays the video rather then just when loading the iframe. So its not "no cookies". But you can mention this into your cookie notices when dealing with GPRP.

### 2018-06-02 - 8.9.4 ###

* Improved: Try to make autoplay in Chrome possible again. See [New Chrome Autoplay behavior](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/autoplay-policy-changes). At the point of writing its not clear if the new iframe attribute makes them just autoplay no matter what. Please report your experiences.

Note they will effect playlist urls like `https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXYApifkdCACM_ykvnCHeth-vIB6v1XE3` only and not those who also reference the starting video. There is currently a separate parameters option for this but it will be removed in version 9.0.

**I could really use some positive reviews. It has been over 7 months without a 5 star review.** The top level menu that was complained about a lot has been removed.

### 2017-05-05 - 8.5.2 ###

* Improved: Embed Liveleak with https. Remove the default parameter.

### 2017-05-05 - 8.5.1 ###

* Improved: Mark Liveleak that it not requires flash anymore. This makes the 'disable links' option of the Pro Addon possible. Becomes very handy as Liveleak annoyingly opens new tabs when clicking outside the play button.

### 2017-05-04 - 8.5.0 ###

* New: playsinline, and muted attributes for HTML5 video.
* Data attributes are no longer prefixed with -arve and various other code improvements.

### 2017-04-25 - 8.4.0 ###

* New: Support for embedding Dropbox hosted HTML5 video files (mp4, webm, ogv). Needs the 'Use ARVE for HTML5 video embeds' to be activated. (Beta feature)
* Fix: YouTube only playlist URLs embedded without https.

### 2017-04-11 - 8.3.1 ###

* Fix: Global CSS id was not correctly added.

### 2017-04-10 - 8.2.5 ###

* Fix: Some Brightcove URLs were not correctly detected.
* Improved: Better automated tests and some minor code enhancements.
* Improved: Some texts, new link to the settings page below parameter field.
* Improved: How aspect ratio is handled for HTML 5 video. If not set (default) the browser will detect it based on the video file that is embedded.
* Improved: Gives the aligned videos a top margin of `0.4em` to try to align them better with text.
* Improved: The 'by ARVE' promotion links do now open in a new tab/window.

### 2017-03-27 - 8.2.4 ###

* Fixed: YouTube cards generate a youtube-nocookie.com url to a channel when the -nocookie.url is used to embedding. tltr; This is actually a YouTube bug but this is fixed in ARVE now by using the normal YouTube url for embeds. I like the additional 'privacy' it provides by not setting cookies as long as the user not plays a video. But considering this is not the first time YouTube has bugs related to this feature, I switched this back and forth in the past, I am considering just not using it anymore.

### 2017-03-25 - 8.2.3 ###

* Fixed: 'Disable links' feature from the Pro Addon was not working.
* Some minor code improvements.

### 2017-03-20 - 8.2.2 ###

* Moved the ARVE menu below the settings menu (where most plugins are), sorry xberg. I got complaints about global menus and I like to keep the global Nextgenthemes menu but 2 global menus is a bit to much. I have given the Nextgenthemes menu a video icon now. I hope this is a good compromise.
* Improved: Finished the German translation.
* Improved: Made the ARVE Pro promotion on the settings menu close-able, hopefully less people get offended.

### 2017-03-20 - 8.2.0 ###

* Fixed: Plugin action links on installed plugin screen
* Fixed: CSS specificity issues by adding a `id="arve"` to the entire document and based all the CSS on `#arve`. This will end a long time battle with themes styles without using bad practices. If you have custom styles overwriting ARVE CSS you may need to increase specificity (or use `!important`).
* Improved: styles and scripts and now served minified unless `WP_DEBUG` is set.
* Improved: styles are now only loaded (to the bottom) when there is a video on the page.
* Improved: Settings title is now 'Advanced Responsive Video Embedder Settings' again rather then just ARVE.

### 2017-03-12 - 8.1.1 ###

* Improved: Added ARVE to menu below plugins so it can be easy found.
* Improved: Used `wp_add_inline_style` function for inline styles.
