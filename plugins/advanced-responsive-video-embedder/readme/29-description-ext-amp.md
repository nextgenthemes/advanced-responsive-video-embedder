### [ARVE AMP][29] ###

When you use the AMP or 'AMP for WP' plugin you need this.

* It will display videos embedded with ARVE on AMP pages correctly
* No options, just works
* It creates `<amp-youtube>`, `<amp-vimeo>`, `<amp-dailymotion>` elements
* For all other video hosts `<amp-video-iframe>` element is used
* Video files are also supported with `<amp-video>`
